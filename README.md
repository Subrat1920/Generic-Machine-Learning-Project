    5. Run the application.py (flask app) to deploy the app locally
            [python application.py]

## Key Features
  1. Data Extraction: Extracts student data from diverse sources (e.g., CSV, databases) for analysis.
  2. Data Cleaning: Cleans and preprocesses the data, handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
  3. Data Modeling: Builds predictive models using machine learning algorithms to predict student performance.
  4. Logging: Implements logging to monitor the execution of the pipeline and troubleshoot issues.
  Exception Handling: Uses exception handling to manage errors and ensure smooth operation throughout the process.
  5. Performance Evaluation: Provides insights into factors influencing student performance, allowing for targeted interventions.

## Technologies Used
  1. Python: For data manipulation, modeling, and exception handling.
  2. Pandas: For data extraction, cleaning, and preprocessing.
  3. Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating predictive models.
  4. Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization and performance insights.
  5. Logging: For tracking the execution and ensuring system reliability.
  6. Exception Handling: To gracefully manage errors and ensure robust data processing.
